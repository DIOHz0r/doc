Translations
============

I know a lot of languages
-------------------------

Great! We are currently translating to Korean, Spanish, Catalan, French, Portuguese, Russian, Japanese and more.

But wait! I'm an expert in a different language
-----------------------------------------------

If you are an expert in a language we are not currently translating, you can request this translation in Transifex and help us to reach more customers in their native language.

Let's Translate
